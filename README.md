were the first to spot their talent and uniqueness, helped them to establish their first 
overseas business based in Osaka. For the past 30 years they have established a very strong 
presence in the retail market. The firm purchases items based on their customersâ€™ demand

is mainly done in terms of cash. In present all the operations are done by manually. The 
availability of authenticated gem stones of the highest quality and range of magnificent 
crafted fine jewelry drives the customers to the organization

Our Client City of Gems Company currently follows a decentralized approach. Manual 
work is extremely time consuming and it is usually involving more employees in the 
process. Process cost is higher because highly paid employees of the company have to 
spend more time for paper documents and printed invoices. The company has to face 
biggest challenge of managing and tracking all expenses is that reports are disappearing. 
The error margin is always greater because the company using manual document 
processing instead of automating the process. Company has to run training continuously 
for staff and newly recruited employees to ensure they follows the correct process. It costs 
more money and time to train the staff. 
Company has manual data entry system and it occurs many problems such as switch details, 
inconsistency in data entry and errors in hand written orders. These problems effect of 
making information unable to be used for make finance reports and unable to find new 
customer trends to improve marketing strategies of the company. 

There are many problems associated with manual system and to overcome these problems 
we need to automate the current system. Proposed system for city of gems will provide 
solution to overcome above problems. Software will gain confident of there is no room for 
errors and makes human oriented processes much easier with efficiency. Integration of 
automated finance system will reduce the pressure of finance team and allowing them to 
work better and cater to the needs of the company. Maintaining a customer database 
enabling customer care executives to take the assistance of the proposed system such as 
sending emails to the customers about new products, offers and discounts. The Company 
will be able to focus more on business operations without worrying about documentation 
problems and other incomplete tasks
